happy_1: the first time you learnt that the owner and bartender where married, it still baffles you
happy_2: laughing with the owner on the stupendous way he broke his hip as he made you orange juice

angry_1: paying the owner 1 silver piece for her to show you the way to the bathroom, only for there to be a neon sign pointing to it

sad_0: annoying the bartender as messengers told you of your parents passing from the choir demons
sad_1: how terrible you felt for loosing that beautiful pendant
